Travis
 	- Listen for changes pushed to master, githb alerts Travis
	- Travis pulls code in repository and 'does work' - like testing and deployment
	- Just give Travis access to repository
	- travis.yml file to tell Travis what to do
		- Have Docker running and ready to build image > Build image with DockerFile > Run tests > Deploy to AWS
 			- Travis runs commands and anything other than 0 return code is a fail
		- before_install: setup before tests are run (use to build image, tag with name so can refer to it)
		- script: commands needed to run test suite
- Elastic Beanstalk
	- Run 1 container
	- EB creates load balancer that manages requests and routes to a VM running docker where the container is stored
	- EB will monitor traffic and auto-scale, add VM's to route new requests to least used server
	- Automatically makes S3 bucket
		- One bucket used for all EB environments made
- deploy section on .travis.yml
	- provider: eb, b/c travis setup with eb to deploy
	- region, based on where EB instance made
	- app: name of app
	- env: name of application
		- Actual app running inside is referred to as environment
	- bucket_name: Travis will copy and zip files and then copy to S3 bucket, or HD on AWS to deploy
		- Need to provide name of bucket Travis deploys to 
	- bucket_path: equal to app name
	- on: branch: master: for deployment
	- access_key_id, secret_access_key: secret key made from new 'User' on AWS IAM service
		- Programmatic access will only allows keeys to be valid through network requests
		- Attach existing policies grants permission to user that is being created (allow all)
		- Access key ID, Secret Access key as environment secrets wit Trav CI or environment variables
- Port mapping through deployment
	- EXPOSE instruction in Dockerfile, EB will look for this instruction for a port to map directly
- PR will allow travis to pull down changes, when go to merge will show that tests have passed
- Docker is just tool in development process. Allow SETTING UP easier, and do not have to redo deployment pipeline for another project
