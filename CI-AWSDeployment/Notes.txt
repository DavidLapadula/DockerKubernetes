Travis
 	- Listen for changes pushed to master, githb alerts Travis
	- Travis pulls code in repository and 'does work' - like testing and deployment
	- Just give Travis access to repository
	- travis.yml file to tell Travis what to do
		- Have Docker running and ready to build image > Build image with DockerFile > Run tests > Deploy to AWS
 			- Travis runs commands and anything other than 0 return code is a fail
		- before_install: setup before tests are run (use to build image, tag with name so can refer to it)
		- script: commands needed to run test suite
