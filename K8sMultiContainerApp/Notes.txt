- NodePort vs ClusterIP service
	- Selector and Label is how deployment knows which pod to manage
	- Service is for NETWORKING. A Nodeport will set up a cluster of pods
	- ClusterIP will expose pods to other objects in the k8s cluster, more restrictive because outisde traffic not allowed
		- Allows anything else in cluster to get access to this IP
 		- Ingress service will alow outisde world to access cluster IP
		- Need selector to determine which set of pods it is to give access TO
			- Port is how OTHER pods gain access to pod cluster-ip governing access to
			- targetPort ON other pod giving acces to (port on the pods being governed)
- Can apply with kubectl with applying a whole file
- Selector is how deployment knows which pods to manage
- Can combine config into multiple files, can put multiple object in a file
	- Difference in config file will try to make new object
