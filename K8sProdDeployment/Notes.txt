- Need to first create a kubernetes cluster, and can make any number of nodes with specific CPU and memory size of VM
- One travis (config file) for each container, so when its pushed CI system updates cluster
    - Before install sign into gcloud sdk, install kubectl, and give user credentials to login properly
    - Need service account to allow the permissions on the service account
- Alpine version of image not the best if the dependencies are required to build the container
- Use volume for encrypted file so container knows about sensitive information like authentication
- Travis CI on local VM to encrypt the file and associated to repo, which is what Travis will use to deploy
    - And then encrypted command in travis.yaml file for before_install to ensure credentials there are getting used
    - Will make encrypted version which is where credentias live, volumed folder means if made in VM will reflect in local machine
    - After Travis unencrypts it, it will place the file inside of the directory so it can be referenced
- Need to set project, compute zone, and cluster
    - Cluster needed so Google cloud can reach out and work specifically with one cluster
